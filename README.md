# Farcaster Coming To Coinbase Wallet

[Coinbase recently announced](https://warpcast.com/coinbasewallet/0x5f8e2bbf) that the Farcaster social-feed and mini-apps (called "frames") will be coming to the **coinbase wallet**.
This would turn the _Coinbase Wallet_ a _Farcaster client app_, potentially bring Farcaster to millions of more users.

If realized, this user-growth would be significant for Farcaster, as (at the time of writing) it is currently the _smallest_ of the (significant) decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks
—
which, in addition to Farcaster, also includes:
Bluesky,
Fediverse,
Mastodon,
Misskey,
Nostr,
Pixelfed,
and others.

Farcaster founder [Dan Romero](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth) emphasized two things that would come to **Coinbase Wallet** due to it integrating **Farcaster**:
Farcaster's **open social-graph**, and the abililty to go **viral**.

A **social-graph** is the _network_ made up of the _people_ on a social-network, and the _connections_ between then.
An _**open** social-graph_ is one that can be accessed by anyone in an **open** & **permissionless** manner.

This (_open_ & _permissionless_ access to the _social-graph_) is a key characteristic of _all_ decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks

including of course Farcaster, but also include the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), **Fediverse**, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), **Nostr**, and many others.

**Going viral** is when a _social-media post_ gains an exceptionally high-level of visibility and engagement in a short period of time.
For example, if the social-media user "joeblow" has 1,000 followers, and his (new) posts are usually only engaged with by (at most) 10 of his followers, then — a **viral** post of his might been seen & engaged with by 30,000 people, which would of course include many people who are not following him.

Although _virality_ has a lot of different types of utiliy, _virality_ is also useful as a _marketing tool_.
For example, a team of people creating a new product or service can bring attention to themselves and their product or service by _going viral_.

[Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) is **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) network, similar to the **Fediverse**, **Bluesky**, **Nostr**, and others.
Farcasster is (at the time of writing) the smallest of these **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) network, but the importance of a social-media network is _not_ just about _how many people_ are on the social-network, but also **who** is on the network.
