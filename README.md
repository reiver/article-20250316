# Farcaster Coming To Coinbase Wallet

[Coinbase recently announced](https://warpcast.com/coinbasewallet/0x5f8e2bbf) that the Farcaster **social-feed** and **mini-apps** (called "frames") will be coming to the [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet).
This collaboration has the potential to transform the _Coinbase Wallet_ into a _Farcaster social-media client_, and potentially bringing Farcaster to millions (if not tens-of-millions or hundreds-of-millions) more users.

If realized, this user-growth could significantly impact Farcaster, which, as of now, is the smallest among prominent decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks such as Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, and others.

## What Is Coinbase

[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to buy, sell, store, and trade various cryptocurrencies, such as Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, and many others.

## What Is Farcaster

[Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) is is a decentralized social-media (DeSo) network built on an open protocol, allowing users to connect freely without the control of a central authority.
Farcaster is similar to Twitter (now called X), Mastodon, and Bluesky in its experience.

Its integration with the _Coinbase Wallet_ would make it easier for people to interact with Farcaster’s social-feed and mini-apps, greatly expanding its user-base.

## Open Social-Graph and Viral Potential

In the announcement, Farcaster founder [Dan Romero](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth) highlighted two key elements that will come to _Coinbase Wallet_:

1. **Open Social-Graph**
2. **Viral Potential**

Coinbase also echoed this on the [2025 roadmap](https://base.mirror.xyz/AStCR6Mtv7U6yEL0K4tpeXvrKaN_LbGySt0tPfn_Eyw) they published:

> We’re rebuilding Coinbase Wallet into an open platform that anyone can build and grow into, and we’re going to help builders go viral. To do this, we’re focusing on:
>
> **Helping apps get discovered.** We’re adding a social graph to the Coinbase Wallet app by leveraging [Farcaster](http://farcaster.xyz/), an open, social protocol that anyone can build on top of. We’ll use Farcaster to power a full social feed, as well as mini-apps with [Frames v2](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/v2/). These are bite-sized onchain experiences — created in minutes — allowing users to take actions without leaving the feed.

## Understanding Virality

**Virality** occurs when a social media post gains significant attention in a short amount of time.
For example, a user with 1,000 followers might see their post engaged with by tens of thousands due to sharing and resharing across the social-network.

This phenomenon is not just about popularity; it’s a powerful marketing tool.
Smaller creators or startups can use virality to gain visibility without relying on paid ads, which many people find intrusive.

## Open Social-Graph

But, what about the **open social-graph**‽
**Virality** happens on a **social-graph** — without a _social-graph_ there is no _virality_.
A **social-graph** is essentially the network of users and the connections between them.
An _**open** social-graph_ is one that can be accessed by anyone in an **open** & **permissionless** manner.

This (_open_ & _permissionless_ access to the _social-graph_) is a key characteristic of _all_ decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks
—
including of course Farcaster, but also includes [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), the **Fediverse**, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), **Nostr**, and many others.
And, is important to developers looking to build an application or service on top of a social-network.

## Why Does Coinbase Care?

While Farcaster stands to gain significant growth from this partnership, one might wonder: _Why is Coinbase interested?_

Several factors may be at play:

* **Dan Romero**'s influence: A former VP at Coinbase, Romero is well-connected within both the cryptocurrency and tech industries, providing credibility and potential leverage.
* **Coinbase Mafia**: Like the "PayPal Mafia," members of the _Coinbase Mafia_ (such as Dan Romero and his Farcaster co-founder [Varun Srinivasan](https://warpcast.com/v)) hold significant sway within the cryptocurrency sector, making this partnership more strategic than purely financial.
* **Onboarding mainstream users**: Coinbase is focusing on onboarding the "next billion users" to cryptocurrencies. Social media is a key vector for reaching non-crypto users, and Farcaster could be instrumental in this mission.

## Bigger Picture: Attracting Non-Crypto Users

While Farcaster currently appeals mostly to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the partnership with Coinbase could be a step towards attracting non-crypto users. This could involve focusing on entertainment, influencers, or other cultural elements that appeal to the masses.
