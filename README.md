# Farcaster Coming To Coinbase Wallet

[Coinbase recently announced](https://warpcast.com/coinbasewallet/0x5f8e2bbf) that the Farcaster **social-feed** and **mini-apps** (called "frames") will be coming to the [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet).
This collaboration has the potential to transform _Coinbase Wallet_ into a _Farcaster social-media client_, and potentially bringing Farcaster to millions (if not tens-of-millions or hundreds-of-millions) more users.

If realized, this user-growth could significantly impact Farcaster, which, as of now, is the smallest among prominent decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks like Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, and others.

## Open Social-Graph & Going Viral

In the announcement, Farcaster founder [Dan Romero](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth) emphasized two things that would come to **Coinbase Wallet** due to it integrating **Farcaster**:
Farcaster's **open social-graph**, and the abililty to **go viral**.

Coinbase also echoed this on the [2025 roadmap](https://base.mirror.xyz/AStCR6Mtv7U6yEL0K4tpeXvrKaN_LbGySt0tPfn_Eyw) they published:

> We’re rebuilding Coinbase Wallet into an open platform that anyone can build and grow into, and we’re going to help builders go viral. To do this, we’re focusing on:
>
> **Helping apps get discovered.** We’re adding a social graph to the Coinbase Wallet app by leveraging [Farcaster](http://farcaster.xyz/), an open, social protocol that anyone can build on top of. We’ll use Farcaster to power a full social feed, as well as mini-apps with [Frames v2](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/v2/). These are bite-sized onchain experiences — created in minutes — allowing users to take actions without leaving the feed.

## Going Viral

**Going viral** is when a _social-media post_ gains an exceptionally high-level of visibility and engagement in a short period of time.
For example, if the social-media user "joeblow" has 1,000 followers, and his (new) posts are usually only engaged with by (at most) 10 of his followers, then — a **viral** post of his might been seen & engaged with by 30,000 people, which would of course include many people who are not following him.
This usually happens due to _mass sharing_ — what Twitter (not X) used to call "retweeting" but now calls "reposting", what Mastodon used to call "retooting" but not calls "boosting", and what Bluesky calls "reposting".

Although, _virality_ has a lot of different types of utiliy, _virality_ is (also) useful as a _marketing tool_.
For example, a small team of people creating a new product (without funds for paid advertising) can bring attention to themselves and their new product by _going viral_.
_Going viral_ is also seen as an acceptable alternative to intrusive advertising, by those to dislike, disdain, and despise instrusive ads.

## Open Social-Graph

But, what about the **open social-graph**‽
**Virality** happens on a **social-graph** — without a _social-graph_ there is no _virality_.
A **social-graph** is the _network_ made up of the _people_ on a social-network, and the _connections_ between then.
An _**open** social-graph_ is one that can be accessed by anyone in an **open** & **permissionless** manner.

This (_open_ & _permissionless_ access to the _social-graph_) is a key characteristic of _all_ decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks
—
including of course Farcaster, but also include the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), **Fediverse**, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), **Nostr**, and many others.
And, is important to developers looking to build an application or service on top of a social-network.

## Bigger Picture

What is in it for Coinbase‽
After all, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to buy, sell, store, and trade various cryptocurrencies, such as Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, and many others.
Why should they care about the Farcaster social-feed or mini-apps‽
It seems clear why Farcaster might desire this parntership
—
_user growth_ for Farcaster,
perhaps also "progress" in the eyes of investors,
clout due to an official partnership with Coinbase,
a higher future valuation for Farcaster due to the partnership,
etc.
But, why would Coinbase be interested in this‽

One factor might be that, Dan Romero has a lot of _social capital_ within Coinbase.
Dan Romero is not only a former employee (a Vice President) at Coinbase, but he and his Farcaster co-founder [Varun Srinivasan](https://warpcast.com/v) are also members of the (so called) _"Coinbase Mafia"_.

The _Coinbase Mafia_, an homage to the [PayPal Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia), is group of early Coinbase employees who each became rich or wealthy due to stock-options they were granted as part of their employment.
Startups often grant stock-options to their early employees as motivation to work hard, and as compensation for working for a startup with — low pay, long and possibly grueling work hours, and no job security.
If these early employees can help turn the startup into a successful company, they are hopefully _rewarded generously_.
Most startups fail and most early startup employees never receive their _generous reward_.
And even for the ones that succeed, the reward is often _less-than hoped for_.
But — for Coinbase and their early employees, it worked out.
Like their _PayPal Mafia_ counterparts, many of the _Coinbase Mafia_ have gone on to found, develop, or invest in additional technology companies.
(Farcaster would be one example of this.)
Within the non-Bitcoin side of the cryptocurrency communities and industry, members of the _Coinbase Mafia_ have a very large amount of _influence_, _sway_, and _soft power_.
Within cryptocurrency circles, the _Coinbase Mafia_ is also sometimes known by the tongue-in-cheek name of _"the cool kids' club"_.
Many investors will invest in any startup they are involved in, no due diligence necessary.
Many companies will hire them, no interview necessary.

Another factor might be that, Dan Romero also has reputation for being very well connected to the rich and powerful in the cryptocurrency industry, and to the broader Tech industry.
He is seen as someone who has access to those who can _move the levers of power_.

Beyond these, this move may fit into a larger picture in the cryptocurrency communities and industries
—
_how to onboard the next billion users onto cryptocurrencies_.
One thought is that the _next billion people_ will come from _regular people_.
And, social-media is seen as a way to get to _regular people_.

With respect to this, one challenge for Farcaster is that №1 (at the time of writing) Farcaster is the smallest of these decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks, and №2 Farcaster's existing users are people already using cryptocurrencies.

This might suggest that Farcaster will soon be looking for ways to attract and bring on people and communities with _no_ cryptocurrency familiarity.
Perhaps by focusing on entertainment, or by bringing on influencers (who would draw their fans to Farcaster), etc.
