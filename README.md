# Farcaster Coming To Coinbase Wallet

[Coinbase recently announced](https://warpcast.com/coinbasewallet/0x5f8e2bbf) that the Farcaster **social-feed** and **mini-apps** (called "frames") will be coming to the [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet).
This would turn the _Coinbase Wallet_ into a _Farcaster social-media client app_, potentially bring Farcaster to millions of more users.

If realized, this user-growth would be significant for Farcaster, as (at the time of writing) it is currently the _smallest_ of the (significant) decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks

which, in addition to Farcaster, also includes:
Bluesky,
Fediverse,
Mastodon,
Misskey,
Nostr,
Pixelfed,
and others.

Farcaster founder [Dan Romero](https://warpcast.com/dwr.eth) emphasized two things that would come to **Coinbase Wallet** due to it integrating **Farcaster**:
Farcaster's **open social-graph**, and the abililty to **go viral**.

Coinbase also echoed this on the [2025 roadmap](https://base.mirror.xyz/AStCR6Mtv7U6yEL0K4tpeXvrKaN_LbGySt0tPfn_Eyw) they published:

> We’re rebuilding Coinbase Wallet into an open platform that anyone can build and grow into, and we’re going to help builders go viral. To do this, we’re focusing on:
>
> **Helping apps get discovered.** We’re adding a social graph to the Coinbase Wallet app by leveraging [Farcaster](http://farcaster.xyz/), an open, social protocol that anyone can build on top of. We’ll use Farcaster to power a full social feed, as well as mini-apps with [Frames v2](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/v2/). These are bite-sized onchain experiences — created in minutes — allowing users to take actions without leaving the feed.

**Going viral** is when a _social-media post_ gains an exceptionally high-level of visibility and engagement in a short period of time.
For example, if the social-media user "joeblow" has 1,000 followers, and his (new) posts are usually only engaged with by (at most) 10 of his followers, then — a **viral** post of his might been seen & engaged with by 30,000 people, which would of course include many people who are not following him.

Although _virality_ has a lot of different types of utiliy, _virality_ is (also) useful as a _marketing tool_.
For example, a small team of people (without funds for paid advertising) creating a new product or service can bring attention to themselves and their product or service by _going viral_.
_Going viral_ is also seen as an acceptable alternative to intrusive advertising, by those to dislike, disdain, and despise instrusive ads.

But, what about the **open social-graph**‽
**Virality** happens on a **social-graph**.
A **social-graph** is the _network_ made up of the _people_ on a social-network, and the _connections_ between then.
An _**open** social-graph_ is one that can be accessed by anyone in an **open** & **permissionless** manner.

This (_open_ & _permissionless_ access to the _social-graph_) is a key characteristic of _all_ decentralized social-media (DeSo) networks

including of course Farcaster, but also include the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), **Fediverse**, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), **Nostr**, and many others.
